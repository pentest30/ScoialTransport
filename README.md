# Social transport solution 

This is a small .Net mvc core based project (still on progress). For transport companies. It enables you to recover drivers and trucks data after uploading  your DDD binary files stored on the driver card. And do detailed reports on the activities of drivers such as duration of work and driving etc ...
the core of the project is based on another project "tachograph-reader" forked from github.
